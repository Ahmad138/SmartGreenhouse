# SmartGreenhouse #
SmartGreenhouse was created with the aim of utilising the capabilities of a RaspberryPi to allow real time monitoring and control of environmental conditions within a greenhouse. SmartGreenhouse reduces labour demand, creates a sustainable, ideal microclimate and when scaled up can contribute to agricultural objectives such as increasing output to meet demand and reducing waste, all whilst being more climate change conscious.
