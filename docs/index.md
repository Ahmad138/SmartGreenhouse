# SmartGreenhouse
SmartGreenhouse was created with the aim of utilising the capabilities of a RaspberryPi to allow real time monitoring and control of environmental conditions within a greenhouse.  SmartGreenhouse reduces labour demand, creates a sustainable, ideal microclimate and when scaled up can contribute to agricultural objectives such as increasing output to meet demand and reducing waste, all whilst being more climate change conscious. 

## Release
**SmartGreenhouse 0.1**  
This release enables sensor readings to be taken and uploaded to the SmartGreenhouse webpage.

**Hardware Installation:**  
**Software Installation:**  

## System Overview 
SmartGreenhouse is a network of sensors that provide real time readings of five environmental conditions within the greenhouse. Historic and current readings can be accessed through your MySmartGreenhouse Account on SmartGreenhouse.co.uk. Should any readings become abnormal or unideal, a warning notification will be sent to your account. You can remotely activate the watering system, heat mat and LED panels as well as set these to automatic.

## Hardware Installation
### Greenhouse
Remove all greenhouse components from packaging. Slide the smaller side panels into the edge of the larger panels. Attach the hinged roof panels with the LED panels on to inside of the greenhouse. Peel off the plastic coating from both sides of the window panes. Move the greenhouse onto the tray and place in the desired position e.g. on a windowsill, on a patio/deck.

### Planter
Take the transparent planter with built in heat mat, your desired soil, and plants, bulbs or seeds. Pour soil into the planter until it is approximately 3/4 full, ensure the heat mat cables remain exposed above soil. Plant your plants, bulbs or seeds according to instructions regarding spacing and depth. If required, water the plants. Place the planter within the greenhouse, onto the tray.

### Watering System
Place the water tank alongside the greenhouse on a flat surface. Stick the motor to the bottom face of the tank, such that the output pipe (faceing upwards) aligns with the hole in the lid. Attach the pipe to the outlet pipe, feed through the lid and into the greenhouse. Secure to the wall using the moveable suction cups. Feed round the inside walls of the planter and ensure the perforated side faces onto the soil bed. Fill the water tank to above the motor, only once set up is complete.

# Frequently Asked Questions
**How do I specify the threshold readings for notifications?**  

**How do I switch the responses to automatic?**  

**I want to view my greenhouse readings over the past month, can I do this?**  
Yes, here at SmartGreenhouse we recognise the importance of progress. Within your MySmartGreenhouse account select the reading you would like to view, then select 'Historic' from the top right button and choose how you wish to display your data. Happy tracking!

**Can I access my MySmartGreenhouse account and take actions from a mobile device?**  
Yes! Our website is accessible on desktop and mobile with all the same functionality. From the mobile version, use the drop down menu to navigate the site. That means you can stay in control of your garden even while travelling, on holiday or if your desktop gives up!

**One of my sensors is not providing any readings, what should I do?**
