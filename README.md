# SmartGreenhouse   [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Team12-UofG/SmartGreenhouse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Team12-UofG/SmartGreenhouse)

## Overview
The aim of the project is to design and develop a modular smart greenhouse that is capable of detecting and responding to a number of changes in environmental conditions in real time. Sensors are used to measure soil moisture, humidity, temperature, UVI/light and air quality. The system will also incorporate LED light, heating and watering systems with automated and manual control. Moreover, the real-time measurements will be displayed on an online web portal enabling the user to view the real-time and historic growth of the plant.

The **SmartGreenhouse** will enable users to monitor and manage their plant growth environment remotely, making this an ideal system for travelling professionals and students or those who live in unpredictable climates.
